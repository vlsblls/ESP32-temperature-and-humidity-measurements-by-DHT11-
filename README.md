# ESP32-temperature-and-humidity-measurements-by-DHT11-
In this program I used the esp32, a lcd 16*2 display and the connection with the thinger.io application.
I programmed the microcontroller to take readings from the dht11 sensor and upload them to the thinger.io platform 
I also used the lcd screen to make a local representation of the readings I got from the sensor. 
I I used three LEDs so that they could show the temperature variation based on their color (1 red ,1 greeen ,1 blue. if the temperature is betweeen 20-30 degrees 
celsious the green will power on.if the temperature is under 20 degrees celsious theblue led will power on. an if the temperature is over 30 degrees celsious the red 
led will power on ).
Îœoreover, I used an extra led to remotely control it through the thinger.io platform
